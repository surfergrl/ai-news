### This is a web app to search for the top news of the day related to AI, format it and email the results to specified email addresses.

## Built by Kat Dawes and Grok3 in Python

### April 2025

Note to self:
Environment Variables in Production: If you deploy this (e.g., on a server), set environment variables via your hosting platformâ€™s settings (ie Heroku).

Further development ideas:

- Add a web interface to allow users to add/delete/change the email addresses the news is sent to.
- Add to the web interface to allow changing search parameters to filter e.g. don't show me anything with 'Elon Musk' in the title / No CNN sites etc.
- Add a curation option for me to edit the selections before they go out
- And an option for me to write an intro so it looks more like an email newsletter
- Create an interface that allows users to create their own personal aggregated newsletter depending on their preferences. They input their own email address and app password, search parameters and recipients. Points to note - how would this work if they tried to email 500k people? What would break?! Security issues etc.
